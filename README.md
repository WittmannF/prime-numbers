# Prime Numbers
Data Analysis on Prime Numbers. Not sure where I want to get here. Just trying to investigate some properties of prime numbers for fun :) Some insights so far:

### Number of prime numbers from 2 to 5,450,147
Answer: 808,696

### Top count of distances between a prime number and the next one

That means that 20% of given times, the next prime number was 6 plus a given prime number (from 2 to 5,450,147). 


### Total number of distances between prime numbers (from 2 to 5,450,147)
76 numbers
