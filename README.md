# Prime Numbers
Data Analysis on Prime Numbers. Not sure where I want to get here. Just trying to investigate some properties of prime numbers for fun :) Some insights so far:

- **Number of prime numbers from 2 to 5,450,147:** 808,696

- **Top count of distances between a prime number and the next one**

That means that 15% of given times, the next prime number was 6 plus a given prime number (from 2 to 5,450,147). 


- **Total number of distances between prime numbers (from 2 to 5,450,147):** 76 numbers
